# Chemivis 
## Visualizing the unseen fundamentals of chemistry
Chemistry is the study of matter, which is made up of atoms and molecules that form everything around us. Yet these particles are invisible to the naked eye, making them difficult to imagine and understand. **Chemivis** bridges this gap by bringing the unseen world of chemistry to life through interactive visualizations and simulations. It helps learners visualize abstract chemistry concepts easier, while also teaching them all about the fundamental topics of the subject!

### Website Outline

**Home Page**: _Welcome to Chemivis_
> This is the main page of our website. It features the website's title and subtitle, an animated background with moving molecules, our logo, navigation links to all other pages, and a short introduction paragraph explaining the purpose of our website. It will also include a footer with our names and credits to all references we will use.

**Interactive Periodic Table**: _Explore the Elements_
> This page displays an interactive periodic table where users can click on any element to view more detailed information not shown in the regular periodic table. A visual atomic model or ring diagram will appear with the pop-up, visualizing the protons and electrons each element has.

**Subatomic Particles**: _Inside the Atom_
> This section focuses on the fundamental particles that make up atoms: protons, neutrons, and electrons. It features a short discussion on them, interactive animations showing how these particles are arranged, and a timeline of the history of atomic models. Visual models will be in place to show how these concepts were improved upon the previous ones.

**VSEPR Theory**: _Geometry with Molecules_
> This page discusses the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, which explains how molecules can have different shapes based on their structures. Here, there will be a discussion on the lesson and an interactive simulation box where users can modify the structure of molecules to update a 3D molecular model in real time to show the resulting shape.

**Balancing Chemical Equations**: _Conserving Atoms Through Balance_
> This page explains the law of conservation of mass and how it applies to balancing chemical equations. An interactive visualizer shows different equations where molecules on both sides of the equation change in number as coefficients change. This makes it easier to see how the numerical equations correspond to real atoms and molecules.

**Practice Games**
> This section compiles short, interactive chemistry games that reinforce learning. These activities will generally be about basic inorganic chemistry topics, such as nomenclature, identifying ions, and matching formulas to names. These games serve as fun ways to review the concepts covered in the previous pages, as well as other lessons users might come across while studying chemistry.

### JS Implementation ##
JavaScript will power most of the interactive features of Chemivis, making static visuals respond to user actions across the website.
- **Interactive Periodic Table:** JS will trigger pop-ups displaying detailed element information and atomic models when a user clicks on an element.
- **Subatomic Particles:** JS will allow users to interact with the atomic model by clicking specific parts to reveal informative pop-ups about subatomic particles.
- **VSEPR Theory:** JS will manage the molecular shape simulation, updating 3D models based on the atomic structure details selected by a user.
- **Balancing Chemical Equations:** JS will dynamically balance chemical equations, updating the visual models from the values in those equations.
- **Practice Games:** JS will handle game logic, including questions, answers, scoring, and feedback to create an interactive learning experience.

Overall, JS will make Chemivis' visualizations less static and more interactive for users.
