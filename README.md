Chemivis - Visualizing the unseen fundamentals of chemistry

Short comprehensive paragraph:
Chemistry is the study of matter, it delves into the core structure of everything around us and how different materials exist. At its core, matter is made up of atoms, which combine to form compounds or molecules, but it visualizing these can be really difficult, especially considering atoms are unvisible to the naked eye! This is what Chemivis aims to solve.
